Credit Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Assignment
Overview
Welcome to the Credit EDA Assignment repository! This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit dataset to gain insights into the data and understand its characteristics. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to inform decision-making processes.
Key Objectives
Data Exploration: Analyze the structure, content, and quality of the credit dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics and distributions of key variables.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering: Identify and create new features that may be relevant for predictive modeling or further analysis.
Insights and Recommendations: Summarize findings and provide actionable insights or recommendations based on the analysis.
Folder Structure
data: Contains the raw credit dataset.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
reports: Documentation including the final report detailing the EDA process, findings, and insights.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas, NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Tools for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for data analysis and documentation.
Usage
To replicate the EDA:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory in sequential order.
Explore the analysis, visualizations, and findings presented in the notebooks
